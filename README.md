Prioritizing mental health awareness aims to confront widespread stigma, fostering a culture of empathy and support. This aligns with a growing societal focus on holistic healthcare, acknowledging the interconnectedness of mental, emotional, and physical aspects.
My project seeks to empower individuals by promoting awareness, aiding in the identification of mental health signs, offering support resources into an encouraging, compassionate and embracing community.
